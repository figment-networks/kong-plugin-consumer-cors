### Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update.

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

Make sure that:
- [ ] Linter do not complains (`pongo lint`)
- [ ] Your changes are covered in specs
- [ ] Run tests and check if they all passed (`KONG_VERSION=nightly pongo run`)
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review open your PR (pull request) with a clear list of what you've done.
Make sure you included specs.
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes
